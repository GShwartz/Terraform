# Terraform

I couldn't get it to work in time. got stuck on the load balancer network connectivity.
Although Terraform is great and I totally see myself working with it, I feel that without any 1 on 1 guidence on specific questions and methods  </ br>
it will take me much longer to get to the solution and understand the core mechanics. 

* I tried to use another machine to act as terminal and I did manaage to SSH from it to the local webservers </ br>
  but I couldn't get to the app via web when it's behind the LB as it is in the IAAC script. </ br>
  
  ports 22 & 8080 were open to any
  LB nat rules were open to any
  I only got connection from the NAT.
